Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
What is Autoo?

Autoo is an AI-powered car diagnostic companion that helps you identify potential car problems by analyzing sounds from your vehicle. By recording or describing a suspicious noise, Autoo compares it against a database of 90+ known car failure sounds and provides likely causes, severity levels, and estimated repair costs.

How does sound diagnosis work?

You can either describe the sound in your own words or record it directly in the app. Autoo’s AI analyzes the input, matches it to known car failure sounds, and returns probable issues with confidence percentages.

What types of car problems can Autoo detect?

Autoo covers a wide range of issues related to engines, brakes, suspension, wheels, exhaust systems, interior noises, and more. The sound database includes over 90 real car failure sounds with audio examples.

Does Autoo provide repair cost estimates?

Yes. Autoo provides estimated repair costs tailored to your car’s make and model, including parts, labor, and repair difficulty.

What is the interactive car diagram?

The interactive car diagram lets you tap directly on the part of the car where the sound is coming from (e.g., engine, wheels, brakes, exhaust). This helps improve diagnostic accuracy.

Can Autoo help with car maintenance?

Absolutely. Autoo includes maintenance tracking for insurance expiry, technical inspections, and service history. It also offers predictive maintenance reminders based on mileage, such as oil changes, brake pads, and timing belt replacements.

Does Autoo track tire health?

Yes. Autoo allows you to monitor tire tread depth for front and rear tires, with clear visual status indicators.

Is Autoo available in multiple languages?

Yes. Autoo supports multiple languages, including English, Spanish, German, French, Polish, Chinese, and Japanese.

Is Autoo a replacement for a mechanic?

No. Autoo is designed to help you understand potential issues before visiting a mechanic. It provides guidance and estimates but does not replace professional mechanical inspection or repair.

Is my data safe?

Yes. Autoo respects user privacy and handles data securely. Sound recordings and vehicle information are used only to provide diagnostic insights and app functionality.
